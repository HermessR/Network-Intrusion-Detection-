# Network Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning  

## Description  
Developing a machine learning-based system for network intrusion detection. The goal is to monitor network traffic and identify suspicious or unauthorized activities that could indicate potential cyber threats, including both external attacks and insider threats. The task involves training a predictive model (classifier) to differentiate between normal (legitimate) connections and malicious (intrusive) ones, enhancing network security by detecting and preventing unauthorized access.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for training and evaluation is taken from Kaggle:  
[Network Intrusion Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection)  

## Setup Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment  
#### **On Windows**  
```bash  
python -m venv venv  
venv\Scripts\activate  
```

#### **On macOS/Linux**  
```bash  
python3 -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  
```

###2️⃣ Install Jupyter Notebook and Required Libraries  
```bash  
pip install jupyter  
```



### 3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook  
To start the project, launch Jupyter Notebook using:  
```bash  
jupyter notebook  
```

Then, open the notebook file and run the code.
